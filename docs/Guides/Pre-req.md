# Getting Started with z/OS Open Source

Before you begin, make sure you have access to a z/OS UNIX environment and that your environment is correctly configured.

## Setting up your z/OS environment

z/OS Open Source tools leverage [z/OS Enhanced ASCII support](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.1.0?topic=pages-using-enhanced-ascii). This support enables automatic conversion between codepages for tagged files. To take advantage of this support, you need to set the following environment variables:

```
export _BPXK_AUTOCVT=ON
export _CEE_RUNOPTS="$_CEE_RUNOPTS FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"
export _TAG_REDIR_ERR=txt
export _TAG_REDIR_IN=txt
export _TAG_REDIR_OUT=txt
```

We recommend adding these environment variables to your `.profile` or `.bashrc` startup script.

## Required Tools

To consume z/OS Open Tools, all you need is a z/OS UNIX system and unrestricted access to github.com.

### If you want to contribute and improve the z/OS Open Source Tools 

You will need the IBM C/C++ compiler on your system. There are two options:
- XL CLang 
  - The default compiler is xlclang. You can download it as a web deliverable add-on feature to your XL C/C++ compiler 
[here](https://www.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/xlCC++V241ForZOsV24).
- Clang
  - You can install and manage _C/C++ for Open Enterprise Languages on z/OS_ using _RedHat OpenShift Container Platform_ and _IBM Z and Cloud Modernization Stack_ 
  - Alternatively, you can download the pax edition from IBM at https://epwt-www.mybluemix.net/software/support/trial/cst/programwebsite.wss?siteId=1803

If you are building Go projects, you will need the IBM Open Enterprise SDK for Go compiler installed. You can obtain it here: https://www.ibm.com/products/open-enterprise-sdk-go-zos

# Collecting Usage Statistics with the z/OS Open Tools Package Manager

Usage statistics collection in z/OS Open Tools Package Manager was introduced to gather anonymized usage data. 
The collected usage data plays an important role in improving functionality, identifying popular packages, and optimizing z/OS Open Tools user experience.
The usage statistics are viewable at this url: http://163.74.88.212:3000/

Note: IBM hostnames are automatically opted in.

## How to Opt-Out After Opting In
* If you initially opted in but now wish to opt out, you can set the `is_collecting_stats` field to false in the JSON file located at: `$ZOPEN_ROOTFS/etc/zopen/config.json`.
